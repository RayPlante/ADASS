\begin{abstract}
In order to make the large number of cron jobs
required to perform data archiving tasks
at the Joint Astronomy Centre more manageable,
we have designed and implemented a dashboard system
for monitoring their progress. 
The status of all of the tasks can be monitored on the dashboard's
web interface, and via consolidated notification emails.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
At the Joint Astronomy Centre (JAC)
we use a large number of cron jobs to
perform data archiving tasks such as transfers to
the Canadian Astronomy Data Centre
for inclusion in the JCMT Science Archive
\citep{2011ASPC..442..203E}.
We must also back up data locally and
ensure sufficient disk space is available
on our data acquisition and reduction machines
before each night of observing.
The cron scheduler runs these
jobs on a given schedule, and by default would send any output by email.
However as the number of machines and cron jobs
running on them increases to cope with
the demands of modern instruments such as SCUBA-2,
we have found that this can lead to an
unmanageable amount of email traffic.
A related problem is that it is
not obvious when a cron job has not been run, for whatever reason.

We therefore designed and implemented a dashboard system,
written in Python,
for monitoring the progress of the tasks. 
Each task reports its status by sending messages
to a server when it starts and finishes.
The finish message can include a status to indicate whether the task
was successful, along with any output.  
A client utility allows crontab files
to be imported so that the system can detect when a job has been missed.


\section{Implementation}

\subsection{Overview}

\articlefigure[scale=0.75]{P04_f1}{fig:arch}{
Diagram showing the architecture  of the Crab system.
The lower section shows the Crab server:
the notification and monitor tasks run as Python threads
while the server task and web interface run under CherryPy
--- a Python web server and framework.
The upper section shows four possible types of cron jobs
(dashed boxes) and how they communicate: either
through the \texttt{crabsh} and \texttt{crab}
utilities, or by directly using the client libraries.}

The architecture of the Crab system is
shown in figure~\ref{fig:arch}.
Crab clients communicate with the server
by sending JSON messages over HTTP.
There are matching Python client and server libraries
which implement the complete protocol.
We have also written a basic Perl client library implementing
a subset of the protocol sufficient for 
reporting the status of cron jobs.

The storage module is a Python object which serves to isolate the
server tasks from the underlying database engine and schema, and would
allow alternative storage mechanisms to be implemented.
The tasks are kept separate from each other, by having them communicate
through this module, except that the web interface needs to be
able to access the monitor task's cache of the job status information
in order to be able to update the dashboard display in
an efficient manner.

\subsection{Client Utilities}


A general client utility, \texttt{crab},
is distributed with the Crab system.
It can be used to send the job start
and end messages, and to import crontab files.
Crontab files can also be exported,
either exactly as last imported,
or as generated from the job records in the database,
including any changes made since the last
import.

To allow existing jobs to easily
be brought into the system,
we have also written a wrapper script, \texttt{crabsh}, which acts
like a shell.
This can be activated for a whole crontab 
simply by setting the \texttt{SHELL}
variable in the crontab to the path to this script.

\subsection{Identification of Jobs}

The central part of the Crab server's response to a message
regarding a job is the identification of the job involved.
This consists of a database search, restricted to the
given host and user name, to determine the job number
--- the primary key of the job table.
The search includes deleted jobs, so that they can
be un-deleted rather than duplicated.
To allow crontabs to be imported with as little change as possible,
it can attempt to recognize jobs from the command string.
However the process can be made more robust by assigning each
job a unique name via the \texttt{CRABID} parameter.
This need only be unique for a given user and host.

The presence of a Crab ID allows the server to detect when a command string
has been changed and update it in the database.
It also allows Crab to distinguish jobs with identical command
strings, such as a job running at multiple times of
day which cannot be combined into a single cron schedule.
Additionally it provides a convenient name for the job
to be displayed on the web interface and in notification messages.

\subsection{Monitor Task}

The monitor task is a Python class which runs in a separate
thread as part of the server.
It polls
the storage module for new events, and
uses
these to update its internal data structures
to indicate
the state of all of the jobs
and which are currently running.
It also caches the cron schedule and timezone for each job,
and checks every minute whether this matches
the current time.
This allows it to insert alarms
into the database
whenever a job is late or missed.
A further check is made for jobs which
have run beyond their
configured time-out period.

Each error status code has an associated severity
(trivial, warning or error)
so that the dashboard display
does not replace an important status with a less significant message.
A successful job completion resets the
display to ``Succeeded'' so that the dashboard
always presents a useful at a glance overview
of the tasks.

\subsection{Notification Task}

One of the goals of developing Crab was to replace
large numbers of separate emails from
the cron daemon with more manageable
consolidated messages.
To this end, Crab includes a
configurable notification system.
Notifications can either be
attached to specific jobs
or configured by host name and/or by user name.
Options for each notification include
the severity level of messages to
display and whether or not to show
the job output
--- if there are no relevant events, the notification
will not be sent.

\section{Example Usage}

An example crontab file
based on two of the data archiving tasks used at the
James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT)
is given in table~\ref{tab:crontab}.
The additions made
to prepare it for use with Crab
are shown in bold
--- all of these jobs simply run under \texttt{crabsh}
rather than having to be made Crab-aware.

Figure~\ref{fig:screenshot} shows
part of the Crab web interface.
To construct this example,
the cron jobs from table~\ref{tab:crontab} were imported,
along with a few more based on JCMT tasks.
Clicking a job's status in the dashboard
leads to a page showing its most recent output.

\section{Conclusion}

The system has made cron job tracking
at the JAC much
simpler, and has made it easier to determine
when there are urgent
issues that need to be attended to.
We have designed the software to be as general as possible,
and hope that other observatories will
find it useful for monitoring
data archiving or other scheduled tasks.
