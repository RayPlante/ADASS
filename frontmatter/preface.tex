This volume of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific (ASP) Conference Series contains papers that were presented at the 22nd annual conference on Astronomical Data Analysis Software and Systems (ADASS XXII), which was held at the I-Hotel and Conference Center, Champaign, Illinois, USA, on 4-8 November, 2012. The ADASS XXII conference was hosted jointly by the University of Illinois and the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA).

\subsection{Conference Overview}
Champaign County, Illinois, USA, was founded in 1833, encompassing a large swath of fertile farmland, and to this day most of the land in the county is used for agriculture. Due to its proximity to Chicago, St. Louis, and Indianapolis, railroad lines were run through the county in the 1850's, bringing a boon to the Champaign County. In 1867 the land grant university, the University of Illinois, was founded in 1867, in the county seat of Urbana.
