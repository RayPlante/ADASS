\begin{abstract}
TESELA is a Virtual Observatory tool which provides a simple interface that
allows the user to retrieve a list of Blank Fields ---regions devoid of bright
stars down to a given threshold magnitude--- available near a given position in
the sky. The initial version of this tool, already presented in ADASS 2011,
made use of the Delaunay triangulation to determine a tessellation of the whole
celestial sphere using the astrometric and photometric information for the 2.5
million brightest stars provided by the Tycho-2 stellar catalogue. More
recently we have used the Delaunay Triangulation to search for deeper blank
fields, with a minimum diameter of 10 arcmin and an increasing threshold
magnitude ranging from 15 to 18 in USNO-B R-band. However, instead of
tessellating the whole sky at once, and considering the exponentially growing
number of stars when moving to fainter stellar magnitudes, we started the
searching procedure by exploring in the subsample of the initial Blank Field
list derived from the Tycho-2 stellar catalogue containing Blank Fields with
size larger than 10 arcmin. Some of these new Deep Blank Fields were
tested with the 10.4 m Gran Telescopio Canarias and have been included in the
nightly operation, demonstrating to be extremely
useful for medium and large size telescopes. The new catalogue is also
available through the TESELA interface which, in addition, provides galactic
extinction information from the NASA/IPAC Infrared Science Archive. 
\end{abstract}

\section{Previous Work}

In \citet[][hereafter paper~I]{2011MNRAS.417.3061C} \citep[see also
contribution in previous ADASS~XXI:][]{2012ASPC..461..173C} we already
described a method, based on the use of the Delaunay Triangulation, that helps
to determine the availability of blank fields in any region of the celestial
sphere. For that purpose, we employed the Tycho-2 stellar catalogue, which
contains astrometric and photometric information for the 2.5 million brightest
stars in the sky, and is complete up to magnitude $V=11.5$~mag
\citep{1997A&A...323L..49P}. In addition, we also presented TESELA, a Virtual
Observatory tool that provides a simple interface that allows the user to
retrieve the list of blank fields available near a given position in the sky.

\section{Recent Improvements}

More recently \citep[][hereafter paper~II]{2012arXiv1209.4861J} has
extended that work by searching for even deeper blank fields, for which it has
been necessary to apply the above method to the USNO-B Catalogue
\citep{2003AJ....125..984M}, which contains astrometric and photometric
information for more than a billion stars and galaxies in the sky. We have used
the 10.4~m Gran Telescopio Canarias, located at the Observatorio Roque de los
Muchachos (La Palma, Spain) as a test-bed for the validation of the deep blank
fields. In particular, we have employed the OSIRIS instrument
\citep{2000SPIE.4008..623C} which has an unvignetted field of view of $7.8'
\times 7.8'$. 

Finally, we have created a set of 87 deep blank fields, suitable
to be used with OSIRIS+GTC, but which is also useful for current medium- and
large-size telescopes. An example of one of these deep blank fields is shown in
Fig.~\ref{example_DBF}. In this figure we compare the deep blank field with a
similar field extracted from the collection of blank fields by Marco
Azzaro,\footnote{\url{http://ing.iac.es/~%
%{\raise.17ex\hbox{\boldmath$\scriptstyle\mathtt{\sim}$}}%
meteodat/blanks.htm}}
who created a short list of 38 blank fields void of stars up to 10--16 mag,
which for many years has been in use at the Isaac Newton Group of Telescopes.

catalogue (\emph{left panel}) and a blank field from Azzaro's catalogue
(\emph{right panel}). Note that two apparent detections, both in the
right-upper part in CCD1 (left side of the detector) and in the left-bottom
part in CCD2 (right side of the detector) are dust grain effects on the OSIRIS
CCDs, and they do not correspond with any star in the field (they are also
visible in the Azzaro's field).}

\section{The Procedure to Determine Deep Blank Fields}

Given the huge number of stars in the USNO-B Catalogue, in this work we have
followed a methodology that is different from the one adopted in paper~I.
Instead of tessellating the whole sky at once, we
used the following workflow:
\begin{itemize}
  \item[i)] Select all the blank fields with a size larger than 10~arcmin using
  the catalogue derived from paper~I.
  \item[ii)] Tessellate each of these regions individually, using the positions
  of the USNO-B objects down to a given threshold magnitude
  $m_{\mbox{\scriptsize th}}$.
  \item[iii)] Create the new deep blank field catalogue from the new collection
  of deeper blank fields, selecting those with a size larger than 10~arcmin.
  \item[iv)] Repeat the whole process, increasing 
  $m_{\mbox{\scriptsize th}}$ from 15 to 18, in steps of 1~mag (see
  Fig.~\ref{result_DBF}).
\end{itemize}

It is important to highlight that since the USNO-B Catalogue was built from
photographic plates (taken from different surveys) which were scanned and whose
sources were extracted in an automatic way from the scanned data, the Catalogue
contains defects and artifacts. As explained in paper~II, in this work an
important effort has been devoted to reduce the impact of those defects in the
determination of the Deep Blank Field Catalogue. Finally, we visually checked
all the deep blank fields with $m_{\mbox{\scriptsize th}}=18$~mag in order to
confirm their validity before transferring them to the operation staff of the
Gran Telescopio Canarias.

\section{Using the Catalogue}

The new Catalogue is accessible through TESELA, the Virtual Observatory tool
presented in Paper~I, that was developed by the Spanish Virtual Observatory
and which is publicly available at\,\,\url{http://sdc.cab.inta-csic.es/tesela}.
TESELA presents the result of the cone search in a table
that can be downloaded in CSV format for further use. In addition, the search
result can be easily displayed with the help of Aladin,\ooindex{Aladin, ascl:1112.019}
providing the user with
the full capacity and power of the Virtual Observatory.

Although our main goal in this work was to provide a list of deep blank fields
for data calibration, these fields can also be used for other purposes, such as
deep pencil-beam extragalactic surveys. For that reason we also provide
extinction parameters determined from The Galactic Dust Reddening and
Extinction utility of the NASA/IPAC Infrared Science Archive, making use of the
data from \citet{1998ApJ...500..525S}.
