\textsc{The Astronomical Society of the Pacific} is an international, 
nonprofit, scientific, and \,\,educational organization. 
Some 120 years ago, on a chilly February evening in San Francisco, 
astronomers from Lick Observatory and members of the Pacific Coast 
Amateur Photographic Association---fresh from viewing the New Year's Day 
total solar eclipse of 1889 a little to the north of the city---met to share 
pictures and experiences. Edward Holden, Lick's first director, complimented 
the amateurs on their service to science and proposed to continue the good 
fellowship through the founding of a Society ``to advance the Science of 
Astronomy, and to diffuse information concerning it.'' The Astronomical 
Society of the Pacific (ASP) was born.

\vspace{5pt}
The ASP's purpose is to increase the understanding and appreciation of 
astronomy by engaging scientists, educators, enthusiasts, and the public to 
advance science and science literacy. The ASP has become the largest 
general astronomy society in the world, with members from over 70 nations.

\vspace{5pt}
The ASP's professional astronomer members are a key component of the
Society. Their desire to share with the public the rich rewards of 
their work permits the ASP to act as a bridge, explaining the mysteries 
of the universe. For these members, the ASP publishes the Publications 
of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific (PASP), a well-respected monthly 
scientific journal. In 1988, Dr. Harold McNamara, the PASP editor at 
the time, founded the ASP Conference Series at Brigham Young University.  
The ASP Conference Series shares recent developments in 
astronomy and astrophysics with the professional astronomy community.
