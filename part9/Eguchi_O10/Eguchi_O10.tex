\begin{abstract}
\ssindex{observatories!Earth-based!ALMA}ALMA is estimated to generate TB scale data during only one observation; astronomers need to identify which part of the data they are really interested in. We have been developing new \ssindex{software!user interfaces}GUI software for this purpose utilizing the\ssindex{Virtual Observatory(VO)} VO interface: ALMA Web Quick Look System (ALMAWebQL) and ALMA Desktop Application (\ssindex{applications!Vissage}\ssindex{packages!Vissage}Vissage). The former is written in \ssindex{computer languages!JavaScript}JavaScript and HTML5 generated from \ssindex{computer languages!Java}Java code by the \ssindex{web!development tools!Google Web Toolkit (GWT)}Google Web Toolkit, and the latter is in pure \ssindex{computer languages!Java}Java. An essential point of our approach is how to reduce network traffic: we prepare, in advance, "compressed" \ssindex{data formats!FITS}FITS files of 2x2x1 (horizontal, vertical, and spectral directions, respectively) binning, 2x2x2 binning, 4x4x2 binning data, and so on. These files are hidden from users, and Web QL automatically chooses the proper one for each user operation. Through this work, we find that network traffic in our system is still a bottleneck towards TB scale data distribution. Hence we have to develop alternative data containers for much faster data processing. In this paper, we introduce our data analysis systems, and describe what we learned through the development.

\section{Introduction}

Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (\ssindex{observatories!Earth-based!ALMA}ALMA) is the largest \ssindex{astronomy!radio}radio telescope built on the Chajnantor plateau in northern Chile, and it is expected to provide us with much useful information to deepen our understanding of the universe due to its unprecedented high resolution data in space and spectrum.

\ssindex{observatories!Earth-based!ALMA}ALMA is estimated to generate $\sim$200\ TB observational raw data every year, and the volume of a processed data cube for one target may exceed 2\ TB. One has to consider 1) how to bring such a big data cube into his/her computer, and 2) how to extract fruitful information from the data cube on the computer.

\section{Method}

To solve these problems, we apply ``binning'' and ``cut-out'' to a data cube. An \ssindex{observatories!Earth-based!ALMA}ALMA data cube has 4 dimensions: right ascension (R.A.), declination (Dec.), channel (frequency), and \ssindex{astronomy!polarization}polarization. Current Science Verification data do not have \ssindex{astronomy!polarization}polarization, and they are identical to 3-dimensional data cubes. In the binning stage, we make every $q \ (q = 1, 2, 2^{2}, 2^{3}, \cdots)$ pixels into one pixel in the R.A. and Dec. directions, and every $p \ (p = 1, 2, 2^{2}, 2^{3}, \cdots)$ channels into one channel. By binning, the data cube size becomes $p q^{2}$ times smaller than original one. We prepare all binned data cubes in advance. In the cut-out stage, one should download a subset of the data cube which he/she is interested in. By a combination of binning and cut-out, we can reduce network traffic drastically.

\section{System Configuration and Use Case}

	\caption{A perspective of the system. There are two web and one desktop applications.
	\label{O10_f1}}
\end{figure}

We developed a new on-line system \citep{D5_adassxxii} consisting of two web\ssindex{web!applications} applications (JVO portal and web viewer) and one desktop application (desktop viewer; \citealt{P047_adassxxii}) shown in Figure~\ref{O10_f1}.

The use case is below:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item A user visits the \ssindex{Virtual Observatory (VO)!individual!Japanese Virtual Observatory (JVO)}Japanese \ssindex{Virtual Observatory (VO)}Virtual Observatory (JVO) portal site: url{http://jvo.nao.ac.jp/portal/}.At this site, the user searches and selects data cubes which contain his/her objects of interest. However, he/she cannot figure out where his/her interested region in each data cube is, and which resolutions are adequate for his/her research.
	
	\item The user launches the web viewer from the result pages. The web viewer enables the user to change resolution, viewing position, and zoom graphically, hence he/she confirms the desired cut-out region and binning factors exactly.
	
	\item The user downloads the data cubes to his/her local hard disk via the web viewer, and launches the desktop viewer.
	
	\item The desktop viewer has much functionality to look at each data cube in detail, and the user can obtain enough information about the objects by this viewer.
\end{enumerate}
The user can iterate this process if he/she wants.

\section{ALMAWebQL}


\subsection{Implementation}

ALMAWebQL is a web viewer which enables a user to find his/her sufficient binning factors and a cut-out region graphically (Figure~\ref{O10_f2}, left)\footnote{You can watch the screen video on \url{http://youtu.be/48IJ5G-5cG4}.}. This is an \ssindex{software!tools!AJAX}Ajax application built on \ssindex{web!development tools!Google Web Toolkit (GWT)}Google Web Toolkit, utilizing the HTML5 Canvas component.

A web browser provides very limited programming interfaces, and it is difficult to access the local file system inside the browser. However, one can perform simple operations without any servers by utilizing  \ssindex{computer languages!JavaScript}JavaScript. We let the web browser do as many, {\bf but simple} operations, as possible to reduce network traffic. In case of ALMAWebQL, we implemented coordinate transforms and zoom functionality with \ssindex{computer languages!JavaScript}JavaScript.

Figure~\ref{O10_f3} is a schematic block diagram of ALMAWebQL, which consists of a web client and an\ssindex{web!applications} application server. The\ssindex{web!applications} application server contacts the\ssindex{Virtual Observatory(VO)} VO server in \ssindex{databases!querylanguage!ADQL}ADQL, and retrieves a proper \ssindex{data formats!FITS}FITS file from the file server when a user does certain actions on the web client. Then the\ssindex{web!applications} application server sends back the \ssindex{data formats!FITS}FITS header information and image to the web client as a \ssindex{computer languages!JavaScript}JavaScript object.

\subsection{Problems Working Towards a Production Release}

We evaluate the system performance and found some problems working towards a production release. Figure~\ref{O10_f2} (right) shows the relation between \ssindex{data formats!FITS}FITS file size and file processing time of the\ssindex{web!applications} application server. It is obvious that file retrieval time is dominating. To solve the problem, the file server should be more intelligent to reduce network traffic.

Currently, this is only in the idea stage, but a new database savvy hierarchical data cube container might be a solution.

	server.\label{O10_f3}}

\section{Summary}

\ssindex{observatories!Earth-based!ALMA}ALMA generates a big data cube for one object, and it may exceed 2\ TB. On the other hand, both network bandwidth and computer resource are limited. To solve these problems, we developed a\ssindex{Virtual Observatory(VO)} VO system consisting of two web\ssindex{web!applications} applications and one desktop application. The aim of this system is to reduce network traffic by binning and cut-out.

We provide a web viewer to let a user select his/her adequate binning factors and cut out his/her interested region visually, and also provide a desktop viewer to perform a detailed quick look. However, network traffic is still a bottleneck towards a production release, and a more intelligent file server is required.
