In a collaboration of the \emph{\ssindex{Virtual Observatory (VO)!individual!German Astrophysical Virtual Observatory (GAVO)}German Astrophysical \ssindex{Virtual Observatory (VO)}Virtual Observatory} and \emph{AstroGrid-D}, the \emph{German Astronomy Community Grid}, we provide the registered \emph{Virtual Observatory} service \emph{TheoSSA} for the access and the calculation of stellar spectral-energy distributions. Recently, we extended this service to consider opacities of H, He, C, N, O, Ne, and Mg. We demonstrate the impact of Ne and Mg on model atmospheres.

\section{\ssindex{astronomy!Spectral Energy Distribution (SED)}Spectral Energy Distributions }
\label{sect:seds}

The \emph{\ssindex{Virtual Observatory (VO)!individual!German Astrophysical Virtual Observatory (GAVO)}German Astrophysical \ssindex{Virtual Observatory (VO)}Virtual Observatory} (\emph{GAVO}) is the German contribution to the 
\emph{International Virtual Observatory Alliance} (\emph{IVOA}). The ambitious goal of the \emph{Virtual Observatory} (\emph{VO}) initiative is to help astronomers to easily access data stored in various data centers which are distributed around the world. Furthermore it strives to standardize the handling and retrieval of archived data. Also the development of web interfaces and standalone tools for accessing, querying, and visualizing the data is an important task, that \emph{GAVO} pursues.

The \emph{T\"ubingen NLTE Model-Atmosphere Package} \citep[\emph{\ssindex{packages!TMAP}TMAP},][]{werneretal2003, rauchdeetjen2003} is a sophisticated model-atmosphere code \citep[e.g\@.][]{rauchetal2007}, that was developed over the last 26 years and uses the most recent \ssindex{physics!atomic}atomic data from \ssindex{databases!individual!the model-atom database (TMAD)}the model-atom database \emph{TMAD}\footnote[1]{\url{http://astro.uni-tuebingen.de/~TMAD}}. Elements from hydrogen to xenon can be included into the calculations \citep{rauch2003,werneretal2012,rauchetal2012}. Within the \emph{GAVO} project, \emph{\ssindex{packages!TMAP}TMAP} was made accessible \citep{rauchringat2011}. Already calculated \ssindex{astronomy!Spectral Energy Distribution (SED)}spectral energy distributions (SEDs) can be downloaded via \emph{TheoSSA} and enable a fast and easy \ssindex{astronomy!spectral analysis}\ssindex{software!spectral analysis}spectral analysis. It is controlled via a web interface where the fundamental parameters can be entered. The user receives a list of\ssindex{astronomy!Spectral Energy Distribution (SED)} SEDs within the requested parameter range. For a more detailed analysis, the \emph{VO} service \emph{\ssindex{packages!TMAW}TMAW} (Figure~\ref{fig:tmaw}), the web interface of \emph{\ssindex{packages!TMAP}TMAP}, can be employed to calculate individual atmosphere models. Effective temperatures between 20\,kK and about 300\,kK and surface gravities $4 \leq \log (g / \mathrm{cm/s^2}) \leq 9$ can be chosen. In the beginning,  \emph{\ssindex{packages!TMAW}TMAW} considered opacities of the elements H+He+C+N+O only. We have now extended \emph{\ssindex{packages!TMAW}TMAW} to include Ne+Mg. Depending on the number of models in the \emph{\ssindex{packages!TMAW}TMAW} queue, the requested\ssindex{astronomy!Spectral Energy Distribution (SED)} SEDs will be calculated within a few days. It is even possible to calculate extended grids of\ssindex{astronomy!Spectral Energy Distribution (SED)} SEDs on compute resources of AstroGrid-D\footnote[2]{\url{http://www.gac-grid.net/}}.

\section{The Impact of Neon and Magnesium on Stellar Model Atmospheres}
\label{sect:nemg}

The \emph{\ssindex{packages!TMAW}TMAW} service had hitherto been restricted to H+Ne+C+N+O models in order to deliver\ssindex{astronomy!Spectral Energy Distribution (SED)} SEDs within one day. We recently included the next abundant elements, namely Mg and Ne, in the calculations. A ``full'' model needs now about two or three days, depending on the machine where its calculation is performed.

To study the impact of Mg and Ne in detail, we calculated pure hydrogen models and for comparison models that include either Mg or Ne in addition, using \emph{\ssindex{packages!TMAW}TMAW} and \emph{\ssindex{packages!TMAP}TMAP}. In the \emph{\ssindex{packages!TMAP}TMAP} model, more detailed model atoms were considered (181 levels treated in NLTE with 479 line transitions) and they were calculated until the absolute relative corrections are smaller than $10^{-4}$. To ensure reasonable calculation times,  the \emph{\ssindex{packages!TMAW}TMAW} model considered only 89 levels in NLTE and 132 lines \citep[cf\@.][]{rauchringat2012}.

Ne and Mg have a significant impact on the temperature structure of the entire atmosphere. Figure~\ref{fig:Tstruc} shows that Mg causes a strong decrease of the temperature in the outer atmosphere for $\log m \leq -3$. Since e.g\@. the H\,$\alpha$ line core is formed at $\log m \approx -3.9$, the impact on this line is particularly strong.

We examined the optical hydrogen lines that are often used to determine the effective temperature and / or the surface gravity of a star. In Figure~\ref{fig:HMg}, a pure hydrogen model is compared with a \emph{\ssindex{packages!TMAW}TMAW} and a \emph{\ssindex{packages!TMAP}TMAP} model that also include Mg \citep[$T_\mathrm{eff}=60\,\mathrm{kK}$, $\log g = 7$, solar abundances,][]{asplundetal2009}. The difference between the pure hydrogen model and the  \emph{\ssindex{packages!TMAP}TMAP} model is always larger than the difference between the \emph{\ssindex{packages!TMAW}TMAW} and the \emph{\ssindex{packages!TMAP}TMAP} model. The strength of the central emission of the H\,$\alpha$ line differs only by $\Delta \approx 0.01$ (in relative flux) between the \emph{\ssindex{packages!TMAW}TMAW} and \emph{\ssindex{packages!TMAP}TMAP} models, whereas the pure hydrogen model and the \emph{\ssindex{packages!TMAW}TMAW} differ by $\Delta \approx 0.10$.
