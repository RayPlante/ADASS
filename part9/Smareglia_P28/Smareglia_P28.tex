\ssindex{archives!multiple!Italian Astronomical Archive (IA2)}Italian Astronomical Archives Center (IA2) is a research infrastructure project that aims at coordinating different national and international initiatives to improve the quality of astrophysical data services. \ssindex{archives!multiple!Italian Astronomical Archive (IA2)}IA2 is now also involved in the \ssindex{surveys!Public ESO Spectroscopic Survey of Transient Objects (PESSTO)}PESSTO (Public ESO Spectroscopic Survey of Transient Objects) collaboration, developing a complete archiving system to store calibrated post processed data (including sensitive intermediate products), a user interface to access private data and \ssindex{Virtual Observatory (VO)}Virtual Observatory (VO) compliant web services to access public fast reduction data via\ssindex{Virtual Observatory(VO)} VO tools. The archive system shall rely on the \ssindex{surveys!Public ESO Spectroscopic Survey of Transient Objects (PESSTO)}PESSTO Marshall to provide file data and its associated \ssindex{data!metadata}metadata output by the \ssindex{surveys!Public ESO Spectroscopic Survey of Transient Objects (PESSTO)}PESSTO data-reduction \ssindex{data!pipelines!reduction}pipeline. To harmonize the object repository, \ssindex{software!data handling}data handling and archiving system, new tools are under development. These systems must have a strong cross-interaction without increasing the complexities of any single task, in order to improve the performances of the whole system and must have a sturdy logic in order to perform all operations in coordination with the other PESSTO tools. \ssindex{databases!MySQL}MySQL Replication technology and triggers are used for the synchronization of new data in an efficient, fault tolerant manner. A general purpose library is under development to manage data starting from raw observations to final calibrated ones, open to the overriding of different sources, formats, management fields, storage and publication policies. Configurations for all the systems are stored in a dedicated schema (no configuration files), but can be easily updated by a planned Archiving System Configuration Interface (ASCI).

\section{Introduction: \ssindex{archives!multiple!Italian Astronomical Archive (IA2)}IA2 \& \ssindex{surveys!Public ESO Spectroscopic Survey of Transient Objects (PESSTO)}PESSTO}

The \ssindex{archives!multiple!Italian Astronomical Archive (IA2)}IA2 data center \citep{molinaro_spie12}, hosted by \ssindex{observatories!Earth-based!INAF-OAT}INAF-OATs (Italian National Institute for Astrophysics - Astronomical Observatory of Trieste), fully manages data archiving, ingestion and user access for telescopes like the \ssindex{observatories!Earth-based!TNG}TNG (\textit{Telescopio Nazionale Galileo}, Galileo National Telescope), the \ssindex{observatories!Earth-based!LBT}LBT (Large Binocular Telescope) and the \ssindex{observatories!Earth-based!Asiago Astronomical Observatory}Asiago Astronomical Observatory (operated by the INAF-Astronomical Observatory of Padova). The data center also hosts mirror portals for other projects (e.g. the BaSTI, a Bag of Stellar Isochrones and Tracks, web portal) and is involved in surveys like \ssindex{surveys!GAPS}GAPS (Global Architecture of Planetary Systems) and \ssindex{surveys!Public ESO Spectroscopic Survey of Transient Objects (PESSTO)}PESSTO (Public ESO Spectroscopic Survey for Transient Objects).

For the \ssindex{surveys!Public ESO Spectroscopic Survey of Transient Objects (PESSTO)}PESSTO survey \ssindex{archives!multiple!Italian Astronomical Archive (IA2)}IA2 is in charge of creating the full archive of processed data, that means preparing an archive structure able to map the \ssindex{data!pipelines!reduction}pipeline from raw data to final products. Together with the archive, \ssindex{archives!multiple!Italian Astronomical Archive (IA2)}IA2 also provides data access to the PESSTO community (and other users) through a web \ssindex{software!user interfaces}GUI (Graphical User Interface) and\ssindex{Virtual Observatory(VO)} VO services (initially based only on public survey products). The \ssindex{archives!multiple!Italian Astronomical Archive (IA2)}IA2 data center will also provide an easy release of final data to ESO (European Southern Observatory) for the so called \textit{Phase III} submission, i.e. validated science data ingestion.

In this paper we present the \ssindex{archives!multiple!Italian Astronomical Archive (IA2)}IA2 archive for \ssindex{surveys!Public ESO Spectroscopic Survey of Transient Objects (PESSTO)}PESSTO (\S\ref{ia2archive}), how it collaborates with the Marshall tool (\S\ref{ia2marshall}) and how data access is structured (\S\ref{dataaccess}), and finally, conclusions on the current status and future developments.

\section{PESSTO@\ssindex{archives!multiple!Italian Astronomical Archive (IA2)}IA2 Archive of Processed Data}\label{ia2archive}

The raw data from the survey observations are processed using a dedicated \ssindex{data!pipelines!reduction}pipeline developed by S. Valenti. The \ssindex{data!pipelines!reduction}pipeline produces two types of products:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
	\item fast reduction public data (during night observations)
	\item final reduction underlying specific policy (at a later time)
\end{itemize}
Reduction products are inserted by users in Marshall and pushed from there to \ssindex{archives!multiple!Italian Astronomical Archive (IA2)}IA2. 
To design the archive at \ssindex{archives!multiple!Italian Astronomical Archive (IA2)}IA2 a set of constraints have been used:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
	\item the \ssindex{data!pipelines!reduction}pipeline structure with intermediate and \ssindex{data!ancillary}ancillary data products
	\item retrieval use cases
		\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
			\item data selection from a single survey run (all or part)
			\item ESO \textit{Phase III} data set identification
			\item single object retrieval with related data (raw, \ssindex{data!ancillary}ancillary products)
			\item survey run identification
			\item selection on different file type (i.e. flat, bias, \ssindex{data!ancillary}ancillary, etc.)
		\end{itemize}
	\item the \ssindex{data!pipelines!reduction}pipeline inserts into \ssindex{data formats!FITS}FITS product headers information on product types, relations, and references
\end{itemize}
These constraints formed the basis for modeling the archive database (see Figure \ref{fig:dbpipeline}). Each \ssindex{data!pipelines!reduction}pipeline product, final or intermediate, contains a \ssindex{data formats!FITS}FITS header coded keyword that defines the file type and its role in the data flux model. This key is decoded by a "model descriptor" present in a relational database (\ssindex{databases!MySQL}MySQL). All useful \ssindex{data!metadata}metadata for \ssindex{surveys!Public ESO Spectroscopic Survey of Transient Objects (PESSTO)}PESSTO use cases are coded in a "data model" table, captured from \ssindex{data formats!FITS}FITS headers and inserted in the appropriate database tables. Those tables are related to each other in order to guarantee information consistency and references between raw data, intermediate, final, and ancillary products. Files are appropriately stored in a highly available storage.
\articlefigure[]{part9/Smareglia_P28/P028_f1.eps}{fig:dbpipeline}{\ssindex{surveys!Public ESO Spectroscopic Survey of Transient Objects (PESSTO)}PESSTO data survey files, incoming from an observation through the Marshall, are ingested according to the \ssindex{data!pipelines!reduction}pipeline structure into a relational \ssindex{databases!MySQL}MySQL database while \ssindex{data formats!FITS}FITS \ssindex{data!metadata}metadata are stored in a set of observational and technical DB tables. Relationships also exist to raw data files (available from ESO archives). The main exposed section of the relational DB are the final objects (scientific data) output of the \ssindex{data!pipelines!reduction}pipeline processing.}

\section{\ssindex{archives!multiple!Italian Astronomical Archive (IA2)}IA2 \& Marshall Interaction}\label{ia2marshall}

PESSTO Marshall is the supervisor of the whole survey processing system, starting from observation schedule to object classification. \ssindex{surveys!Public ESO Spectroscopic Survey of Transient Objects (PESSTO)}PESSTO observers submit their data products to the Marshall application (developed at the Queen's University in Belfast) that registers the event and then pushes the data to \ssindex{archives!multiple!Italian Astronomical Archive (IA2)}IA2. Information of data insertion and storage success should come back to Marshall. These two facilities need to interact to provide a homogeneous and robust archiving system. Interaction is performed by taking strong advantage of \ssindex{databases!MySQL}MySQL Replication capability and the use of triggering systems. The main steps of the interaction involve:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
	\item final products push to \ssindex{archives!multiple!Italian Astronomical Archive (IA2)}IA2, performed by Marshall
	\item data ingestion at \ssindex{archives!multiple!Italian Astronomical Archive (IA2)}IA2, triggered by DB backup replication
	\item \ssindex{archives!multiple!Italian Astronomical Archive (IA2)}IA2 reports ingestion status and file access URL to Marshall
	\item Marshall updates its system, triggered by DB replication
\end{itemize} 
At the end of the process the user, using either Marshall or the \ssindex{archives!multiple!Italian Astronomical Archive (IA2)}IA2 portal, will be able to access and retrieve the data from the same position (physically located at \ssindex{archives!multiple!Italian Astronomical Archive (IA2)}IA2) in a transparent way. This interaction between the two separated (also geographically) systems enables the two tools to provide their own functionalities (survey supervising and user access for the Marshall, data archiving and \ssindex{data!pipelines!reduction}pipeline access for the \ssindex{archives!multiple!Italian Astronomical Archive (IA2)}IA2 archive) while keeping the data system always up to date. Collaboration between \ssindex{archives!multiple!Italian Astronomical Archive (IA2)}IA2 and the Marshall goes further, since the use of the replicated system is widened to a larger part of the Marshall DB to provide a backup system to the Marshall primary server. A spare endpoint will be provided by \ssindex{archives!multiple!Italian Astronomical Archive (IA2)}IA2 to \ssindex{surveys!Public ESO Spectroscopic Survey of Transient Objects (PESSTO)}PESSTO users, this spare Marshall system will be continously updated (both the interface system and the underlying DB) using a subversioning system and \ssindex{databases!MySQL}MySQL Replication.

\section{Data access}\label{dataaccess}

Once data are correctly ingested at \ssindex{archives!multiple!Italian Astronomical Archive (IA2)}IA2, the final products are visible (transparently for the user) both from the Marshall application and the \ssindex{archives!multiple!Italian Astronomical Archive (IA2)}IA2 web \ssindex{software!user interfaces}GUI or the\ssindex{Virtual Observatory(VO)} VO compliant \ssindex{surveys!Public ESO Spectroscopic Survey of Transient Objects (PESSTO)}PESSTO web services (private data serving through\ssindex{Virtual Observatory(VO)} VO is under study). The choice of one or the other interface depends on the query being performed:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
	\item Marshall is "object classification" oriented
	\item \ssindex{archives!multiple!Italian Astronomical Archive (IA2)}IA2 \ssindex{software!user interfaces}GUI is position, run, and file search oriented
	\item\ssindex{Virtual Observatory(VO)} VO compliant web services are devoted to data interoperability at various scales and levels
\end{itemize}
Here we present the IA2 \ssindex{software!user interfaces}GUI (\S\ref{ia2web}) and the ongoing effort to publish the \ssindex{surveys!Public ESO Spectroscopic Survey of Transient Objects (PESSTO)}PESSTO data through the \ssindex{International Virtual Observatory Alliance (IVOA)}IVOA (International Virtual Observatory) protocols (\S\ref{vo}).

\subsection{\ssindex{archives!multiple!Italian Astronomical Archive (IA2)}IA2 Web Portal}\label{ia2web}

IA2 \ssindex{surveys!Public ESO Spectroscopic Survey of Transient Objects (PESSTO)}PESSTO \ssindex{software!user interfaces}Graphical User Interface is in charge of providing a wide range of selections with the use of many different types of filters. Initially it will serve a file subcollection based on final products \ssindex{data!metadata}metadata and will perform a dedicated query for the ESO \textit{Phase~III} products release, but it is planned to provide selections also on intermediate and ancillary products, based on information codified in file names, or to perform a subquery on specified final product ancillary files. It guarantees, in any case, the policy on private data and \ssindex{data!metadata}metadata using a dedicated authentication page while file release is hidden by a method (in the initial version, by a File Server, under development, at the final stage). The File Server will provide the Marshall with access to final products through \ssindex{archives!multiple!Italian Astronomical Archive (IA2)}IA2.

\subsection{VO Services}\label{vo}
Besides the traditional web portal for data query and retrieval (described in the previous \S\ref{ia2web}) the \ssindex{surveys!Public ESO Spectroscopic Survey of Transient Objects (PESSTO)}PESSTO data, at least the publicly available part of it, will be exposed through\ssindex{Virtual Observatory(VO)} VO compliant web services. This solution well help users in exploiting the survey's data potential combining \ssindex{surveys!Public ESO Spectroscopic Survey of Transient Objects (PESSTO)}PESSTO results with other\ssindex{Virtual Observatory(VO)} VO available astrophysical resources. At present a couple of demo services are published using VO-Dance (\cite{molinaro_spie12}, the \ssindex{archives!multiple!Italian Astronomical Archive (IA2)}IA2 service publishing web\ssindex{web!applications} application) and allow for a search through a catalog of \ssindex{surveys!Public ESO Spectroscopic Survey of Transient Objects (PESSTO)}PESSTO classified super\ssindex{astronomy!novae}novae and a set of fast reduction spectra (based on the catalog set of objects). The two services\footnote{Simple Cone Search catalog is reachable at http://palantir18.oats.inaf.it:8080/ivoa/resources/cone/71 while Simple Spectral Access URl is http://palantir18.oats.inaf.it:8080/ivoa/resources/ssap/72} (consumable by\ssindex{Virtual Observatory(VO)} VO aware client applications) will be upgraded, to dynamically expose all public \ssindex{surveys!Public ESO Spectroscopic Survey of Transient Objects (PESSTO)}PESSTO data, once the Marshall system and its interaction with \ssindex{archives!multiple!Italian Astronomical Archive (IA2)}IA2 are at a stable maintenance status.

\section{Conclusions}

The IA2 \ssindex{surveys!Public ESO Spectroscopic Survey of Transient Objects (PESSTO)}PESSTO archive mapping the survey's \ssindex{data!pipelines!reduction}pipeline products and its integration with the supervising Marshall application is currently starting the production phase, with data ingestion ready, but not with dynamic interaction set up in a stable way. Once the full system is up and running users will access \ssindex{surveys!Public ESO Spectroscopic Survey of Transient Objects (PESSTO)}PESSTO data through their preferred tool no matter where data are, simply selecting the desired result type (final products, raw data, runs, etc.). In this view, \ssindex{archives!multiple!Italian Astronomical Archive (IA2)}IA2 has the role of a consolidated distributed archiving system supplier, providing both data and infrastructure back-up storage, data release and publishing.

From the\ssindex{Virtual Observatory(VO)} VO point of view the deployed resources will be improved taking advantage of the Marshall and \ssindex{archives!multiple!Italian Astronomical Archive (IA2)}IA2 interaction, however an authentication mechanism for\ssindex{Virtual Observatory(VO)} VO resources is under a study phase, to free the users from the proprietary data issue currently limiting the\ssindex{Virtual Observatory(VO)} VO world.
